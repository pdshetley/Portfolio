        <p>Botanica is a proposed line of skincare products made with botanical ingredients derived from organic herbs, fruits, and flowers. It’s skincare that I would love to find on the shelves of my local co-op.

        <h3>Brand Development</h3>
        <p>I created the name, brand, product mockups, and e-commerce website.
        Following are rough sketches for my initial thoughts on the brand personality.

        <h3>Preference Test</h3>
        <p>I created a Preference Test on UsabilityHub for these 2 logo options I finalized in Illustrator. The bottom logo was the overwelming preference with 84% of the respondents preferrring it.

        <h3>Low Fidelity Prototypes &amp Userflows</h3>
        <p>I started with low fidelity wireframes in Sketch3 to work out the basic layout and to determine some user flow. Since the word, Botanica, does not immediately say what the product is, a hero image is a good visual device to quickly explain the product.

        <h3>Brand Application &amp Product Mockups</h3>
        <p>The product line has three main categories which are a cleanser, a toner, and a moisturizer. I created category names that reflect the benefit of each category - Purify, Nourish, and Protect. With these three categories I created a color palette of aqua, mint, and pink that would communicate which category each product fit into. I changed the color of the logotype area accordingly and design for the packaging reflects which category the item fits in.

        <h3>High Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
        <p>On the home page I wanted the call-to-action to be very obvious with framed content in the center of the hero image. This frame replicates the graphic feel of the logo and is where the changing promotions are highlighted. The benefits of the products are clearly presented and opportunites to shop are provided with product descriptions and in the product slide at the bottom of the page. 
        </p>
        <div class="one-half">
          <img src="images/BotanicaHiFidelity1.png">

        <div class="one-half">
          <img src="images/BotanicaHiFidelity2.png">
        </div>
        <p>I changed the hero image from one of flowers to a product shot to more quickly convey the purpose of the product. I incorporated background imagery that reinforced the products’ ingredients - herbs, fruits, and flowers.
        </p>
        <img src="images/Botanica-Site-Final.png">
        <p>If I had more time I would put the products in amber glass bottles and create the boxes from scratch. I would love to print the packaging labels and boxes and photograph actual mockups that I’ve created myself. I think that organic and naturally sourced products are really gaining popularity and are on the minds of consumers. Maybe an enterprising manufacturer of natural beauty products would like to collaborate?
