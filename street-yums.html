        <p>This proposed mobile Android app is a foodtruck locator. People want to find fast, delicious food nearby and this app lets them search, find, order, pay, list favorites, and share comments for great street food.

        <h3>Brand Development</h3>
        <p>This app was originally name PayCrave with a little pig as its logo. I felt that that name focused more on the paying aspect of the app rather than the promise of finding delicious street food so I changed the name. And the pig was not a happy symbol for users who are vegetarian. I designed this style guide in Illustrator.

        <h3>Low Fidelity Prototypes &amp Userflows</h3>
        <p>Here are some of the protype and userflow sketches. I developed map or list views, menu categories to keep the selection process simpler, the order and payment process, including a way for users to sign up to make future orders go faster. The ability to post comments, mark favorites, and share with contacts provided its social aspect.

          <h3>Color Mockups</h3>
        <p>Purple is used for buttons where a userâ€™s action is needed. Red and orange are proven color choices to stimulate the appetite, increase excitement, and convey energy. I worked in Sketch3 to produce the mockups and Photoshop to create some of the assets.
